<!-- What happens if you lose your work?

If you make frequent commits, you reduce the risk of losing significant progress. Each commit acts as a save point. So, even if your current changes are lost or corrupted, you can revert to the last commit without losing everything.

How easy is it to find bugs?

Frequent commits help isolate changes, making it much easier to trace bugs. You can use tools like git bisect to identify which commit introduced a bug, which is nearly impossible if all changes are in one large commit.

What if you want to undo a specific change?

With smaller, focused commits, it's easier to revert just one specific change without affecting unrelated parts of the project. A big commit makes it hard to selectively undo changes. -->
